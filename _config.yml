  Welcome to this site! I'm a theoretical physicist and this is my <mark>portfolio</mark>. At the top of the page, you can find various icons leading to social platforms which detail who I am -- both personally and profesionally. I would consider myself as a rather chill and an approachable person so please do not hesitate to contact me, even if it is just to say hi!

  Cheers!

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
